»The name and situation of the emperor John

[j Cantacuzene might inspire the most lively curio-

“ sit-y. ,His memorials of forty years extend from

the revolt of the younger Andronicus to his own
abdication of the empire, and it is observed, that,

. like Moses and Caesar, he was the principal ac-
·tor in the scenes which he describes. But in this

eloquent work. we should vainly seek the sin-
cerity of an hero or a penitent. Retired in a
cloyster from the vices and passions of the world
he presents not a confession, hut an apology, of
the life of an ambitious statesman. Instead of
unfolding the true counsels and characters of men,
he displays the smooth and specious surface of
events , highly varnished with his own praises and
those of his friends. Their motives are always
pure5 their ends always legitimate: they conspire
and rebel without any views of interest3 and the
violence which they inflict or suffer is celebrated
as the spontaneous effect of reason and virtue«

Scr. Bonnae mens. Sept. a. 1828.
